## 📉 Business Problem

Logistics teams often lack a centralized, visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs), leading to:

- Fragmented decision-making across departments  
- Inability to compare performance across regions, time periods, or categories  
- Delayed identification of underperforming shipping modes or states  
- No visibility into customer or product-level logistics contributions
